Update `README.md`:

- every time we create a new agent workflow (in `.agent/workflows`) or update an existing one (section `AI Agent Workflows`);
- every time we create a new Python script (in `scripts`) or update an existing one (sections `Files Tree` and `Python Scripts`).

The section `What I did` is updated manually; don't touch it unless the links are no longer valid.
