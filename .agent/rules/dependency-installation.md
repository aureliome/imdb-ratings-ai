description: Ensure dependencies are installed before running scripts
---
Always set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt` before running Python scripts.
You can do this by running:
1. `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
